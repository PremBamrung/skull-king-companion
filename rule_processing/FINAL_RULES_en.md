Are you truly brave enough to join my crew? Then climb aboard, and shout a vigorous: **"Yo-ho-ho!"**

## 2. SETUP AND KEY CONCEPTS

### SETUP

1. **Remove the following 8 cards** for your first few games: the blank cards (4), the Loot cards (2), the Kraken (1), and the White Whale (1). These cards are used with the advanced rules.
2. Deal each player a player aid and a set of bid reminder cards.
3. Shuffle the remaining cards.

### KEY CONCEPTS (GLOSSARY)

* **Trick:** Each player, in clockwise order, plays one card face up. The strongest card wins the trick. The won cards are gathered in front of the winner.
* **Round:** A set of tricks. The number of tricks is equal to the number of cards dealt (e.g., Round 3 = 3 cards per player = 3 tricks).
* **Suit:** The numbered cards from 1 to 14 (Green, Purple, Yellow, and Black).
* **Trump:** The black cards (**Jolly Roger**). They are stronger than all other color suits.
* **Follow Suit:** The first colored card played determines the suit to follow. Other players *must* play this color if they have it. Cards without numbers (Special cards) do not have a color.

## 3. PLAYING A ROUND

The game takes place over **10 rounds**.

### A. DEALING

* Round 1: 1 card per player.
* Round 2: 2 cards per player... and so on up to 10 cards in Round 10.
* *Note for 7-8 players:* Reduce the number of cards in rounds 9 and 10 if necessary so everyone receives the same number.

### B. BIDDING (THE "YO-HO-HO!")

After looking at your cards, estimate the exact number of tricks you think you will win.

1. Everyone knocks their fist on the table three times shouting **"Yo-ho-ho!"**.
2. On the third knock, extend a number of fingers corresponding to your bid (or a closed fist for zero).
3. Use the **bid reminder cards** to mark your bid in front of you.
4. One player notes all bids on the scorepad.

### C. PLAYING THE TRICK

The player to the left of the dealer starts the first trick.

* Play proceeds clockwise.
* You must **follow the requested suit**. If you do not have it, you can play any other color (including the black trump) or a special card.
* The winner of the trick leads the next trick.

---

## 4. CARD HIERARCHY

### COLORED CARDS

* **Classic Suits (Green, Yellow, Purple):** If multiple cards of the same color are played, the highest number wins. If a different color is played (excluding trump), it cannot win.
* **Trump (Black):** A black card beats any card of another color, regardless of its value.

### SPECIAL CARDS

These can be played at any time, even if you have the requested color.

* **Escape:** Losing to all other cards. If everyone plays an Escape, the first player wins the trick.
* **Pirate:** Beats all numbered cards. If multiple Pirates are played, the first one played wins.
* **Tigress:** The player chooses at the moment they play it if it is an **Escape** or a **Pirate**.
* **Skull King:** The King of the game. He beats all Pirates and all numbered cards.
* **Mermaid:** Beats all numbered cards. She loses against Pirates, **BUT she wins against the Skull King**.

> **[Captain's Log]:** If a Pirate, the Skull King, and a Mermaid are in the same trick, the **Mermaid always wins**, because she captures the King.

### STARTING A TRICK WITH A SPECIAL CARD

* **If it is an Escape:** The next card determines the suit to follow.
* **If it is a Character (Pirate, Mermaid, Skull King):** There is **no suit to follow**. Other players play whatever they want.

## 5. SCORING (SKULL KING SYSTEM)

You only score points if your bid is **exact**.

### BIDDING 1 OR MORE

* **Successful Bid:** +20 points per trick won (e.g., bid 3 and won 3 = 60 pts).
* **Failed Bid:** -10 points per trick difference (too many or too few). You score 0 points for your won tricks.

### BIDDING ZERO (THE "ZERO")

* **Successful Bid:** +10 points multiplied by the number of cards in the round (e.g., Round 7 successful at zero = 70 pts).
* **Failed Bid:** -10 points multiplied by the number of cards in the round (e.g., Round 9 failed = -90 pts).

### BONUS POINTS

These are only awarded if your bid is **correct**:

* **The 14:** +10 points for a colored 14, +20 points for the black 14.
* **Character Capture:**
* A Pirate captures a Mermaid: **+20 pts**.
* The Skull King captures a Pirate: **+30 pts**.
* A Mermaid captures the Skull King: **+40 pts**.

## 6. VARIANT: RASCAL SYSTEM

Ideal for a more balanced game. Each round has a potential of **10 pts per card dealt**.

* **Direct Hit (Exact Bid):** 100% of the round's points.
* **Glancing Blow (Difference of 1):** 50% of the round's points.
* **Complete Failure (Difference of 2+):** 0 points.

### Optional Rule: Buckshot vs. Cannonball

After bidding, secretly choose your mode:

* **Buckshot (Open Hand):** Standard Rascal rule (points for difference of 0 or 1).
* **Cannonball (Closed Fist):** +15 pts per card if exactly successful, 0 pts if incorrect (even by a single trick).

---

## 7. 2-PLAYER RULE: THE GHOST OF GREYBEARD

Shuffle and deal 3 piles. The third pile belongs to the ghost of **Greybeard**.

* Greybeard always plays in the 2nd position.
* Simply flip the top card of his deck on his turn. He does not follow suit.
* If he wins the trick, he starts the next one (flip his next card).
* His **Tigress** is always an Escape.

---

## 8. ADVANCED RULES AND EXPANSIONS

### LEVIATHANS OF THE DEEP

* **The Kraken:** Destroys the trick. All cards are discarded. No one wins. The player who would have won leads the next trick.
* **The White Whale:** Destroys special cards and turns colors into simple numbers. The highest numbered card (regardless of color) wins.

### ADDITIONAL CARDS

* **Loot:** Creates an alliance. If the giver of the loot and the winner of the trick both make their bid, they gain **+20 bonus pts**.

### PIRATE POWERS (VARIANT)

If you win a trick with a pirate, use their power immediately:

* **Rosie the Sweet:** Choose who starts the next trick.
* **Will the Bandit:** Draw 2 cards, discard 2.
* **Rascal the Gambler:** Bet 0, 10, or 20 pts (won or lost depending on your final bid).
* **Juanita Jade:** Look at the undealt cards.
* **Harry the Giant:** Modify your bid by +1 or -1 at the end of the round.

---

## 9. DURATION VARIANTS
